This is a project created by Puru Anand (purua@uci.edu), Radhika Sharma (radhiks3@uci.edu) and Ritu Jha (jhar2@uci.edu) as a part of their course requirement at UC Irvine. Course CS271P - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

## Details/Explanations about the files
The [make_dataset](make_dataset.py) Python file creates the [final_dataset](final_dataset.csv) CSV file uisng the [Sentiment140](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) dataset CSV file. It is named '1m_tweets.csv' in the Python file.

The different Jupyter notebooks perform different tasks as per their names.
If trying to execute any notebook on its own, you would have to add a folder to your Google Drive called 'CS271P_Project' containing the [final_dataset](final_dataset.csv) file and a folder called glove, in which these unzipped [GloVe word embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip) are present.
